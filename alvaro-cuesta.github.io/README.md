## TODO

  components renders SVG instead of fonts)
- Try to use filter for highlight, or at least shomehow highlight `#projects`
- Blog posts
  - Comments from GH issues?
  - Ensure it has proper OG meta tags (and overrides the global ones)
  - Add manual description OR autodescription https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-infer-description-meta
  - Add reading time https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-infer-reading-time-meta
