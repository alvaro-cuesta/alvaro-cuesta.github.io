## TODO

- Maybe use FontAwesome React packages? Or my own icon but ensure it behaves the same (I think their
  components renders SVG instead of fonts)
- Try to use filter for highlight, or at least shomehow highlight `#projects`
- Blog posts
  - Comments from GH issues?
  - Ensure this is done through suspendable promises -- also implement some sort of cache
  - Ensure it has proper OG meta tags (and overrides the global ones)
