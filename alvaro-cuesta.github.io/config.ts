 * Timezone to use as input when converting a "dumb" JS `Date` to an internal `BlogItemDate` (which has plain
 * dates/times).
 *
 * When converting a `Date` object it will be assumed to be in this timezone regardless of the actual timezone. This
 * will allow anyone to specify a `Date` as a value which can be run in any server in the world.
 *
 * This MUST be the same implied timezone of the rest ofthe plain dates. E.g. if you blog post filenames are named
 * 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm__slug.mdx` then the timezone should be the same as the one used to generate the filenames.
